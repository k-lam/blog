##coordinate 

###world coordinate 

X is defined as the vector product Y.Z (It is tangential to the ground at the device's current location and roughly points East).

Y is tangential to the ground at the device's current location and points towards the magnetic North Pole.

Z points towards the sky and is perpendicular to the ground.

###screen / sensor coordinate

The sensor coordinate system used by the API for the natural orientation of the device does not change as the device moves, and is the same as the OpenGL coordinate system.
